Title:
Starfetch

Elavator Pitch:
A game that has your favourite fruit catch mechanic except it's "out of this world"! Get it? Instead of catching
boring fruit in a basket, you get to use a big fluffy cloud to catch falling stars!

30 second gameplay description:
You start the game and it begins with a countdown. The moment it counts from 3 to 1, you have to start
moving the cloud at the bottom of your screen with your mouse OR arrow keys to catch the stars that have began to 
fall. The more stars you get, the higher your score is. Certain stars give you certain power ups depending on the
star. There is the "shooting star" which gives the player speed, the "comet" which increases the size of the cloud,
and a defected power up "twinkle" which if caught, shrinks the cloud so that it's harder to catch the stars..

Features
Cloud as the "basket". 2 Power up stars, one called "Shooting Star" that allows you to speed up your cloud, and
"Comet" which enlarges the cloud for more surface area. There is also a power down called "Twinkle" that shrinks
the cloud if accidentally caught.
